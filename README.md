# Multi-Layer Perceptron for chess analysis

This is my end of degree project for Informatics Engineering.

## Description

This project is the creation and design of a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) which is trained to get a before and after position of a move in chess and outputs its evaluation and some explanation on why it's a good/bad move.
In the project you can find different versions of the project and how they have been designed and trained, from the first network which only shows evaluation of board to the last with the whole explanation of the position and move.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* This project has been made with the latest versions of Python (3.11) and executed on Windows 10.
* It uses [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish). To use it, just download and place it in the stockfish folder and update the main.py path.

### Installing

* To start using the program, simply download the project.

### Executing program

* To use only the final and already trained version, just run the main.py file.
* If you want to execute and see the whole process of training, it's recommended to use a code editor.
